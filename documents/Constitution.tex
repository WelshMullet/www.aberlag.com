\newpage
\section{Elections}
\label{elections}

	All members (excluding Associate members) of the society have the right to vote the societies elections. Those members which can vote are hereafter refereed to as {\em voting members}. Elections shall take place in accordance to this constitution, following the rules defined below.
	
	The committee must choose a returning officer to run all elections. They shall be responsible for totalling the votes, and announcing the results. The winner(s) of the election shall be decided by a simple majority vote.
	
	All elections shall take place no less than 14 days after the notification has been sent out to all members of the date, time and place.
	
	\subsection{Vacancies}
	
	Upon any vacancy occurring outside of normal election procedure, the Vice-President must decide on another member of the Committee to temporarily hold the vacant post until a by-election is completed for the vacancy.
	
	\subsection{Annual elections}
	
	An election shall be held at the end of each academic year for the entire set of committee positions. The returning officer for the Annual Election may not be one of the candidates.
	
	\subsection{`Postal' votes}
	
	For all elections, members with the right to vote in society elections (hereafter described as `voting members') must be provided with an alternate way to vote. For a period starting no less than one week before the election, up to the start of the election, the Returning Officer must accept letters from voting members describing their vote. A list of members who have voted by this method should be kept, so that they may not vote a second time during the election. This enables those members who may be unable to attend the elections to still have a vote.

\subsection{Vote of no confidence}

A vote of no confidence is a vote between members for the immediate dismissal of an elected or appointed committee member.

All voting members of the society have the right to propose a vote of no confidence, at any point, if either the majority of the Committee agrees, or a petition of signed by 10 voting members or a majority of the voting members (whichever is lower) agrees. The vote of no confidence must then be held at the following meeting - all members of the society must be informed at least one week before this, including the committee member who is being voted upon. The vote of no confidence shall be decided with a simple majority vote.

A vote of no confidence may not be called until a period of no shorter than one month of term time has passed since the election the committee member was voted in at.

\newpage
\section{Meetings}
\label{meetings}

	\subsection{Committee Meetings}
	
	A general meeting should be held at least once a month, if not more, in order to keep the amount that must be discussed at the meeting short. This should be an opportunity for all members to bring up issues or points they may have.

	\subsection{General Meeting}
	\label{agm}

	An General Meeting shall be held at the end of the academic year. The agenda of the General Meeting shall be:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To consider any motions that have been brought forward that require consideration before any further points are made.

		\item To receive reports from all the committee members on their activities in the last year.
		\item To receive a financial report, including the accounts of the previous financial year and a budget for the current financial year.
		\item To formally handover the elected positions from the outgoing committee to the incoming committee.
		\item For any constitutional amendments to be ratified, and the constitution to be approved as accurate for the forthcoming academic year.
		
		\item To consider any motion brought forward during the meeting or added to the set agenda.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	The Secretary should give at least 14 days notice of the time, data and place of the General Meeting.
	
	The General Meeting should follow all rules that apply to regular meetings, though those declared above take priority.	

	\subsection{Emergency General Meeting}
	
	The Emergency General Meeting will be an emergency procedure used when the survival of the society comes into question. The committee shall call an EGM when in their discretion a `serious emergency' arises. Once called, information regarding the meeting must immediately be announced to all members at least 14 days in advance. During the meeting, all ordinary members and above will have an equal vote on the future direction of the society.

\chapter{Activities}
% --------------------------------------------------

The society will run multiple types of activities. These include both ``shootouts'' which require no special organisation, and ``scenarios'' which are larger events that may require special organisation and rules. The society may also run activities that do not fit the below descriptions.

\section{``Shootouts''}

Shootouts are minor events, that should require no other organisation than a time and date, and moderators only if the event will have a large number of people attending.

All shootouts must follow the rule-book, which shall be made available in a separate document.
This document - `The Aberystwyth Live Action Games Society Rulebook' - shall include both the Basic Rules and the Scenario Rules (see below).

	\subsection*{Moderators}
	
	Moderators shall be appointed by the elected committee only, and must be either a committee member or an ordinary member.
	
	The moderators will have additional powers during ``shootouts'' and will be able to oversee and enforce rules, with the power to impose minor penalties. They are expected to have knowledge of the societies rules, and may be asked to moderate for events that require a fixed set of moderators.

\section{``Scenarios''}

Scenarios are major events, that may require special organisation and have additional rules specific to the scenario. In addition to the Basic Rules, scenarios will have an additional set of rules - the Scenario Rules - that they must follow.

	\subsection*{Moderators}
	
	Scenarios will have a defined group of moderators for the entire event, selected by the committee. These moderators are not necessarily the same ad the moderators appointed for general ``shootout'' events. These moderators must not take part in the event.

\chapter{Constitution}
% --------------------------------------------------

\section{Documentation}

A copy of this constitution shall be kept by the Secretary and distributed to members upon request. The Students Activities Officer shall also hold a copy, which must be submitted annually in a paper format. A copy shall also be put on the website.

\section{Amendments}

Amendments to this constitution happen in the following fashion. The proposed Amendment must be submitted to the Committee not within 14 days of a General Meeting. The Committee will then discuss the proposed amendment and then suggest any changes that would be suitable. The amendment is then proposed at the General Meeting where it must be ratified by a majority. Changes to policy (see \sref{policy}) are not subject to these rules, and may be changed as soon as they are ratified at a committee meeting.

Any changes to this constitution shall only come into force after the close of the meeting unless otherwise stated in the amendment or constitution.

\section{Interpretation}

In the event of any question of interpretation arising the Committee shall have the power to act accordingly to its interpretation of the constitution, or, if it does not cover the issue, then a constitutional amendment should be presented by the Chair at the next Committee Meeting.

	\subsection{Language}
	
	This constitution should be made available in both Welsh and English.
	
	Should there be any dispute over the constitution between the Welsh version and the English version, the English version shall take precedence.

\section{Approval}

The Constitution must be approved by a majority in order to stand as a true and accurate authority of the members of the society for the forthcoming academic year.

This constitution shall come into force at the start of the 2012-2013 academic year, to allow for amendments to be made during the summer period.

\chapter{Policies}
\label{policy}

\section{Age of Associate Members}

While non-university students are welcome to join as Associate Members, we will require that all associate members are at least 18 years old\footnote{This is due to potential legal issues that we would not be able to deal with, as well as the general issues involved with having younger players.}.

\section{Unoffical Shootouts}

Shootouts or similar events organised by other players and groups are encouraged, but we require that anyone wishing to advertise through us must comply with (at minimum) our safety rules, in cases where they apply.

Shootouts that do use our rules, and that are organised by the societies members have permission to use the 'unofficial' \society{} logo (a grey-scale version of the official logo) in their advertising.

\section{Online Communication}

Online communications (such as the societies Facebook page) shall be subject to a ``three strikes'' rule, in order to keep communications friendly.
The Committee shall mark a ``strike'' against people who make inappropriate or rude comments, and any member reaching three ``strikes'' shall be given a temporary ban from the online community.
The length of the ban will be a minimum of 3 days, and will double for each previous ban the user has been given.
The Secretary shall be in charge of administrating these procedures.
