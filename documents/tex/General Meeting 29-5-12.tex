\section{Agenda}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Welcome from President} \\ Sam Clements, President, will talk on the subject of the society's future.
		\item \textbf{Constitution} \by{Sam Clements}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The members present at the meeting will discuss the constitution and debate on what should be kept and new items can be added. This new constitution will be finalized and handed into the guild.
			\item Consistent weekly/monthly meetings with agendas and minutes, as well as a set format for the meeting notes. It has been proposed that the agenda for a meeting be made public as soon as possible, so that people can ensure their motions are included. A proposal for the format and rules of the meeting notes is included in the proposed constitution.
			\item A set of base rules for events, that can be accessed by all members (preferably both online and in print form).
			\item Removing the name "Lockwood Arms Group". The suggested new name is "Aber Live Action Gaming" or some variant thereof. Military vernacular should be avoided with regards to the society, as it's bad for public image. \\ - \by{Seth Khan, Sam Clements}
			\item Membership fees and benefits.
			\item Bilingualism.
		\end{itemize}

		\item \textbf{Health and Safety} \by{Tabby Key}
		\begin{itemize}
