*12th to the 19th of October*

The Administrators will be running an Assassin game in partnership with AberLAG, with a story introducing the zombie virus! Assassin uses a different set of rules to our games, with an entire rulebook dedicated to 'killing' other players in a huge number of ways - traps, radioactive glowsticks, poisoned lipstick, and the ever popular banana gun.

Contact [assassinaber@googlemail.com](mailto://assassinaber@googlemail.com) both to sign up and for more details.
