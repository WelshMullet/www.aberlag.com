title: Scenario Rules
---

Scenarios are our major events, such as [Humans Vs Zombies](http://humansvszombies.org/) or [Assassin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_%28game%29). They have rules of their own, in addition to the [society rules](/rules/).

### Markers

Scenarios often distinguish between teams with a marker - generally an armband or bandanna of a certain colour. The marker must be visibly worn at all times (unless you are in a safe zone). You may only tag players wearing a marker - assume people without a marker are not playing

If you think a player is cheating by removing their marker, contact the moderators instead of acting as if they are in the game.

### Safe Areas

As these events are normally played across campus, certain areas are defined as &quot;safe zones&quot; where the game is permanently suspended. Blasters and other equipment should be concealed, and no players may be stunned or tagged. This is to avoid disruption to members of the public, and danger to anyone involved.

All indoor areas (especially public areas such as cafeterias and shops) are safe zones. 
		
Tags made in a dangerous area (such as a busy road or to/from a vehicle) are immediately invalidated and should always be avoided. Players should always avoid these areas.

### Camping

Camping is defined as *&quot;blocking an entrance to a safe area, such that a player cannot enter or exit the area without an immediate risk of being tagged&quot;*. Players who are camping may be shot at from inside the safe area, and may acquire other penalties from the moderators.
