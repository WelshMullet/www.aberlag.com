There are many variants for Micro HvZ, and these will take some time to explain. The most common variants are listed below.

### Vanilla Micro HvZ

##### Setup

Players are divided into humans and zombies. "Alpha" zombies, i.e., starting zombies are chosen from volunteers or, their numbers being inadequate, chosen by moderators at random. The initial number of "alphas" is dependant on the number of people playing. A good rule of thumb is a zombie for every 5 people. Zombies are given a central respawn point.
Humans are sent to the middle of the play area and face inwards, looking down at the ground while the zombies disperse. Once the zombies have hidden, humans are allowed to leave the center and game begins.

NOTE: Sometimes the initial placement is flipped, and humans disperse while the zombies begin at their respawn point.

##### Gameplay

Humans move around the play area while avoiding getting tagged by a zombie. Hitting a zombie with a dart counts as a tag, and they must return to their respawn point before attacking again.

Zombies tag humans by a touch of the hand (it is generally accepted that the palm must be touching, not just a brush of the fingers). Upon being tagged, the newly infected must return to the respawn point, drop their gun and any other accessories they no longer require and then respawn as a zombie. Only then may they tag humans.

After a set time-limit (generally 15 minutes, sometimes more or less) the EXTRACTION POINT is activated. After this takes place, the remaining humans have a few minutes (generally 5 minutes) to make their way to the extraction point. The extraction point is usually on the other side of an obstacle (a bridge for example).

##### Objectives

Humans - avoid getting tagged and survive until you are successfully extracted!

Zombies - tag all the Humans! NONE WILL SURVIVE.


### 'Hard Mode' Micro HvZ

This gamemode introduces several variations to the rules that make the game much harder on the humans.

##### Setup

Players are divided into humans and zombies. "Alpha" zombies, i.e., starting zombies are chosen from volunteers or, their numbers being inadequate, chosen by moderators at random. If this is not the first game to be played at a shootout, the previous 'winners' (to be explained later) are chosen as 'Alphas'. The initial number of "alphas" is dependant on the number of people playing. 'Alphas' are given a headband to wear to distinguish them from normal zombies.
Humans are told to disperse and the 'Alphas' start from a central point.

##### Gameplay

Two major rule changes from Vanilla:
- Multiple respawn points are distributed around the game area. There should be a fairly large number of them.
- Alpha zombies take two hits.

Humans move around the play area while avoiding getting tagged by a zombie. Hitting an alpha zombie with a dart counts as a tag, they must be tagged twice before respawning. Normal zombies (those tagged after the game has begun) are given one life.

Zombies tag humans by a touch of the hand (it is generally accepted that the palm must be touching, not just a brush of the fingers). Upon being tagged, the newly infected must return to the respawn point, drop their gun and any other accessories they no longer require and then respawn as a zombie. Only then may they tag humans.

##### Objectives

Humans - survive as long as possible! The last x humans (where x is equal to the number of 'Alphas') are made 'Alphas' next round.

Zombies - tag all the Humans! NONE WILL SURVIVE.


#### Special Zombies

These are zombies that are sometimes included in games (Vanilla or Hard Mode) to introduce some variety or to quicken the pace of the game (useful if those last humans just won't F@#%&NG die).

##### Spitter

A spitter does not tag by touch. Instead it is given a pistol-type weapon (e.g., a Maverick) and are allowed to shoot at humans. If a human is hit by a spitter dart, they must kneel for 15 seconds. During these 15 seconds they may not move, but they are allowed to continue shooting.

##### Horde Zombie

A horde zombie is. simply put, a mobile respawn point. It has a set number of lives, generally 2 or 3, and other zombies respawn off it by touch. They are only allowed to walk, however.
