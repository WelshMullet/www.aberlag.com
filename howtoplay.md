### Shootouts

Shootouts are our weekly events, usually run at the castle or one of the fields on the campus [(map)]().

They consist of several games, organized by the attending players (and usually moderators). The rules depend on the game type being played - some of the more popular ones are described here.

#### Deathmatch / Team Deathmatch

Tag all other players in an individual game, or tag the other team's players in a team game. Either the first player/team to achieve a set number of kills, or the last player/team to have lives remaining wins.

#### Capture the flag

Grab the flag from the opposing teams base, and return it to your own base - while your own flag is still there - to win! Players respawn either at their teams base, or a set spawn point, and have infinite lives.
