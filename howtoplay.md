*Make sure you have read the [rules]({{ site.url }}rules/) before reading this.*

### Shootouts

Shootouts are our weekly events, usually run at the castle or one of the fields on the campus [(map)](http://goo.gl/maps/RpXkU).

They consist of several games, organized by the attending players (and usually moderators). The rules depend on the game type being played - some of the more popular ones are described here.

#### Deathmatch / Team Deathmatch

Tag all other players in an individual game, or tag the other team's players in a team game. Either the first player/team to achieve a set number of kills, or the last player/team to have lives remaining wins.

#### Capture the flag

Grab the flag from the opposing teams base, and return it to your own base - while your own flag is still there - to win! Players respawn either at their teams base, or a set spawn point, and have infinite lives.

### Scenarios

Scenarios are our major events, such as [Humans Vs Zombies](http://humansvszombies.org/) or [Assassin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_%28game%29). They have rules of their own, in addition to the [society rules](/rules/).

#### Markers

Scenarios often distinguish between teams with a marker - generally an armband or bandanna of a certain colour. The marker must be visibly worn at all times (unless you are in a safe zone). You may only tag players wearing a marker - assume people without a marker are not playing

If you think a player is cheating by removing their marker, contact the moderators instead of acting as if they are in the game.

#### Safe Areas

As these events are normally played across campus, certain areas are defined as &quot;safe zones&quot; where the game is permanently suspended. Blasters and other equipment should be concealed, and no players may be stunned or tagged. This is to avoid disruption to members of the public, and danger to anyone involved.

All indoor areas (especially public areas such as cafeterias and shops) are safe zones. 
		
Tags made in a dangerous area (such as a busy road or to/from a vehicle) are immediately invalidated and should always be avoided. Players should always avoid these areas.

#### Camping

Camping is defined as *&quot;blocking an entrance to a safe area, such that a player cannot enter or exit the area without an immediate risk of being tagged&quot;*. Players who are camping may be shot at from inside the safe area, and may acquire other penalties from the moderators.
