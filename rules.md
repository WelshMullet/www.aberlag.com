### Safety

First are the safety rules. These are important, and breaking them may get you banned from the society.

- **Listen to the moderators**
  <br/> Follow their instructions - especially at the start of games.
- **No physical contact**
  <br/> Don't push, shove or grab at other players.
- **Be aware of your environment**
  <br/> Don't climb on walls (or anything else you could fall from) or otherwise endanger yourself, or other people.
- **Don't use realistic looking blasters**
  <br/> All equipment (in particular, blasters) must not look realistic or be painted in dark colours, and must have orange tips.
  <br/> *Modified or unusual blasters must be checked with the Safety Officer - they must not hurt on impact or have potential to cause injury.*
- **Act sensibly**
  <br/> It may not be covered by the rules. But if could cause danger to another player, or get the game banned: *don't do it*.

### Tagging and Equipment

You can tag another player by shooting them with a blaster, touching them with a melee weapon, or hitting them with a thrown weapon.

When tagging another player, you should call &quot;**HIT**&quot; to ensure the other player notices that they have been tagged.

- **Foam dart/disc blasters**
  <br/> Players are tagged by a direct hit from a projectile. Hits to the feet or blaster do not count.
- **Thrown weapons**
  <br/> Rolled up socks or soft beanbags are used as thrown weapons, and tag players in the same way as blasters.
- **Melee weapons**
  <br/> LARP-style melee weapons tag a player simply by touching them.
  <br/> *Players using melee weapons must have permission from both the current Safety Officer and the current moderator.*

*[direct hit]: The projectile hitting the player or the players equipment and coming to a full stop.

### Etiquette

Shootouts and other events may be competitive, but they are still a game. Respect the other players, and play fairly.

- **Act with honour, integrity and sportsmanship**
  <br/> Don't cheat, ignore the moderators, or attempt to spoil the game for the other players.
- **Dead men don't talk**
  <br/> Inactive (&quot;dead&quot;) players should not interfere with players who are still active.
  <br/> To signify that you are inactive, hold up two fingers or your weapon in the air.
- **Owners**
  <br/> Make sure that darts and other equipment are collected at the end of shootouts, and equipment is returned to its owners.
  <br/> It's fine to use marked darts during a game, as long as they are returned to the owners at the end of the shootout.
